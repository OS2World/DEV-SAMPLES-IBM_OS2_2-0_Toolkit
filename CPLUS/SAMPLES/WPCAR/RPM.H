*  Description:
*
*      This file contains the declaration of class RPM.  RPM is a C++ class
*       whose client is Carpp which is a SOM class.  This is one example of
*       the use of C++ constructs in the implementation of a SOM class.
*
*      RPM is the abstraction of a real car's RPM indicator.  It contains an
*       RPM magnitude which can be set and queried using public member 
*       functions.
